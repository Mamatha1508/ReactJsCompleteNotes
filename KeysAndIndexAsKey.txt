1. Key is the unique value added to each value in the list to uniquely identify it.
2. It is helpful because key keeps a track of each value that is associated to it and whenever there is a change in the list, instead of updating the whole list,it updates only the new value
   as it maintains the track of existing values.
   ex: <li>m1</li>
        <li>m2</li>
        Now we want to add a value at the end of this list.Now the updated list will be like <li>m1</li>
                                                                                             <li>m2</li>
                                                                                             <li>m3</li>
        Here React checks 1st 2 values and as they are in the intended position, it inserts the new value at the end.
        Now suppose if a value to be inserted at the top, then React checks if the new value = existing value and as they differs, Reach changes the whole list instead of just inserting at
        1st position.Inorder to overcome this situation we use keys where key is a unique value associated to each value of the list and whenever any change occurs then it checks for only
        newly added value.
        For ex: <li key="1">m1</li>
                <li key="2">m2</li>
                Now if we want to insert anything at top then React gives new key to the new value and checks if key 1 and 2 already have the values, it remains them as is and adds new value
                at the top.This increases the performance of the application as more operations are not performed.
3. We should not use index as key because whenver the list is changing it causes pblms 
    For ex:
